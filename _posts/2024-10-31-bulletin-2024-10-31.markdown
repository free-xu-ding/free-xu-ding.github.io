**Information on Xu Zhiyong's hunger strike (October 31, 2024)**

### （一）律师依旧不予会见

萧云阳律师接受家属委托后，于29日早上向监狱递交会见申请。30日晚间，申请期48小时即将届满时，律师监狱通知，监狱方面认为律师提交的材料不合格，对其中的文字内容进行了吹毛求疵的质疑和刁难，需要萧律师返回住地重新准备材料再给监狱寄去，等候进一步通知。

### 1) The lawyer still refused to meet Xu Zhiyong
After accepting the family's commission, lawyer Xiao Yunyang submitted a visit application to the prison on the morning of the 29th. On the evening of the 30th, when the 48-hour application period was about to expire, the lawyer was notified by the prison that the prison believed that the materials submitted by the lawyer were unqualified and questioned and made trouble for the text content. Lawyer Xiao was required to return to his residence to prepare the materials again and send them to the prison, waiting for further notice. 

###   （二）面对网友询问，监狱方面表示许志永一切正常

自28至30日，监狱方面的对外沟通电话很难接通。31号，志永的朋友苏雨桐终于拨通了狱政科的电话，希望了解许志永目前的身体情况。接线员说要向领导汇报并记录下她的名字。对于雨桐告知“绝食情况受到国际广泛关注”，接线员很关心绝食消息的来源，并说谣言不可信，许志永一切正常。

山东省鲁南监狱狱政科有接线员接听：
- 国际拔打：0086633326422 
- 国内拔打：06333326422

###  2) In response to netizens' inquiries, the prison said that Xu Zhiyong was fine

From the 28th to the 30th, it was difficult to get through the prison's external communication phone. On the 31st, Zhiyong's friend Su Yutong finally called the prison administration department, hoping to learn about Xu Zhiyong's current physical condition. 

The operator said that she would report to the leader and record her name. Regarding Yutong's information that "the hunger strike has attracted wide international attention", the operator was very concerned about the source of the hunger strike news and said that the rumors were not credible and Xu Zhiyong was doing fine.
An operator from the Prison Administration Department of Lunan Prison in Shandong Province answered the call:

- International dialing: 0086633326422
- Domestic dialing: 06333326422

###  （三）无消息显示许志永的绝食状况，需要持续关注

律师此次在日照已无法会见、更无从确定许志永的真实意思；律师的第二次会见申请不知何时能被批准，会见时间无法知晓。我们要继续加大声援关注、问责监狱、持续行动，直至许志永被保障权利争取到基本诉求，并亲自表示停止绝食为止。

###  3) There is no news about Xu Zhiyong's hunger strike, which requires continued attention

The lawyers were unable to meet with him in Rizhao this time, and there was no way to determine Xu Zhiyong's true intentions; it is unknown when the lawyers' second meeting application will be approved, and the meeting time is unknown. We must continue to increase our support and attention, hold the prison accountable, and continue to take action until Xu Zhiyong's rights are protected and his basic demands are won, and he personally expresses his intention to stop the hunger strike.
