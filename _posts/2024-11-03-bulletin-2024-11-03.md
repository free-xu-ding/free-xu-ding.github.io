首先非常感谢大家对于此次许志永绝食抗争事件的持续关注。

First of all, thank you very much for your continued attention to Xu Zhiyong's hunger strike。


截至11月3日，许志永已经持续绝食31天。我们可以确认的信息包括： 

As of November 3, Xu Zhiyong has been on hunger strike for 30 days. The information we can confirm includes: 

### 一、他绝食的唯一具体诉求“恢复与其未婚妻李翘楚的通信权”未被鲁南监狱批准； 

His only specific demand for hunger strike, "restoring the right to communicate with his fiancee Li Qiaochu", was not approved by Lunan Prison;

### 二、官方一再作梗，使得许志永至今未被允许会见律师，更无任何渠道向外传递真实的身体状况和绝食与否的自主意愿表达； 

The authorities have repeatedly obstructed Xu Zhiyong, so that he has not been allowed to meet with a lawyer so far, and there is no channel to convey his true physical condition and his independent expression of his will to hunger strike;

### 三、许志永虽于29日成功会见了家属，但家属遭到严重警告威胁，当日未敢对外联络。而之后的消息，不论是会见当日的“口头答应”，还是监狱单方面的反馈，都未能有公信力的确切证实许志永是否停止绝食。 

Although Xu Zhiyong successfully met with his family on the 29th, his family was severely warned and threatened and did not dare to contact the outside world that day. The subsequent news, whether it was the "verbal agreement" on the day of the meeting or the unilateral feedback from the prison, failed to provide credible confirmation of whether Xu Zhiyong had stopped the hunger strike.

关注组相信，只要律师无法按程序会见，许志永便没有真实意愿表达的有效渠道；具体诉求的通信权尚未被保障，我们都有理由相信，许志永没有放弃绝食。希望国际社会和各界人士继续投入更多关注力量。 

The concern group believes that as long as the lawyer cannot meet with him according to the procedure, Xu Zhiyong will have no effective channel to express his true will; the specific right to communicate has not been guaranteed, and we have reason to believe that Xu Zhiyong has not given up the hunger strike. We hope that the international community and people from all walks of life will continue to pay more attention.
