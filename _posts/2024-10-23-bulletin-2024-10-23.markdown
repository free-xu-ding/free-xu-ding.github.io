**紧急关注许志永绝食整20天！**

**Urgent attention to Xu Zhiyong's hunger strike for 20 days!**

据悉：为了抗议山东省鲁南监狱非法剥夺他和未婚妻李翘楚的合法通信权，许志永已经从10月4日开始绝食抗争至10月23日，持续整20天，体重在短时间内迅速下降十几斤，健康状况迅速恶化。

It is reported that: in order to protest against Shandong Province Lunan Prison's illegal deprivation of his and his fiancée Li Qiaochu's legal right to communicate with each other, Xu Zhiyong has been on hunger strike from October 4 to October 23, which lasted for the whole 20 days, with his weight rapidly dropping by more than ten pounds in a short period of time, and his health condition rapidly deteriorating.

许志永绝食的具体诉求是捍卫合法通信权。据悉，李翘楚与许志永在8月份被允许正常通信，由于翘楚患有抑郁症和焦虑症，令狱中的志永非常挂心爱人的病情恢复，他们通过手写书信相互支持宽慰，分享生活、交流思想。但是，李翘楚在9月寄的两封信均被以不合格为由扣留，同时许志永也不被允许给对方写信，而在争取通信的过程中，又屡遭审核部门的故意刁难和监区狱警的人格羞辱，抗争不得己升级到了绝食程度。

Xu Zhiyong's hunger strike's specific demand is to defend the legitimate right to communicate. It is reported that Li Qiaochu and Xu Zhiyong in August was allowed to communicate normally, due to Qiaochu suffers from depression and anxiety, so that the prison Zhiyong very concerned about the recovery of his beloved's condition, they support each other through handwritten letters of relief, to share their lives, exchange of ideas. However, Li Qiaochu in September sent two letters were detained on the grounds of unqualified, at the same time Xu Zhiyong is not allowed to write to each other, and in the process of fighting for communication, and repeatedly by the audit department of the intentionally difficult and prison guards of the personality of the humiliation, the resistance had to be upgraded to the degree of hunger strike.

今年7月海外关注组就曾曝出：许志永服刑期间被严重侵犯基本人权；遭监管“包夹”对他进行精神虐待；甚至姓名都在监狱被“消失”。之后的几个月，鲁南监狱不断升级着对他的严管级别、非法剥夺和精神虐待。许志永的选择并非不珍爱生命，这正是他为了不再受到人格侮辱、夺回被侵犯的权利作出的义无反顾的决定。

In July of this year, the Overseas Concern Group revealed that Xu Zhiyong's basic human rights had been seriously violated while he was serving his sentence; that he had been psychologically abused by supervisory “pincers”; and that his name had even been “disappeared” from the prison. In the months that followed, Lunan Prison escalated its level of strict control, unlawful deprivation and mental abuse. Xu Zhiyong's choice was not made out of a lack of love for life; it was an unshakeable decision to stop being humiliated and to reclaim his violated rights.

如今，志永在狱中的身心状况都已到了非常危急的时刻，而长期处于“获而未释”的状态的李翘楚定期遭到相关人员关于”被消失“的警告和威胁，处于被迫消声，无法对外说话。基于山东省鲁南监狱这些具体的作恶者无所顾忌、什么都敢做，希望国际社会和海内外各界人士都能积极关注此事，促使有关部门依法对许志永保障其基本的生命权和健康权。

Today, Zhiyong's physical and mental condition in prison is critical, while Li Qiaochu, who has long been in the “released but not yet released” status, has been regularly warned and threatened by the relevant personnel about “being disappeared”, and has been forced to mute his voice and is unable to speak to the outside world. Based on the fact that these specific perpetrators in Shandong Province's Lunan Prison have no scruples and dare to do anything, it is hoped that the international community and people from all walks of life, both at home and abroad, will take an active interest in this matter, and urge the authorities to guarantee Xu Zhiyong's basic right to life and health in accordance with the law.
