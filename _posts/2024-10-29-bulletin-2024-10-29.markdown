**Information on Xu Zhiyong's hunger strike (2024.10.29)**

### （一）家属会见

29日上午许志永的两位家属去会见了他，但会见结束之后就返回家了；萧律师没有从家属那里获取到有效信息，家属表示不愿透露就急匆匆回家了。李翘楚当天未能联系到志永的家属无法获取有关信息。

### 1) Family members' meeting

On the morning of the 29th, two of Xu Zhiyong's family members went to meet him, but returned home after the meeting; Lawyer Xiao did not obtain any valid information from the family members, and the family members said they did not want to disclose it and hurried home. Li Qiaochu was unable to contact Zhiyong's family members on the same day and could not obtain relevant information.

### （二）律师会见申请

萧律师29日上午提交了会见申请，被告知48小时内会有答复和安排。按照对于许志永申诉案的特殊处理流程，监狱方面接到申请后，会层层上报司法部门请示，所以无法尽快回复能否会见。萧律师在酒店等候进一步的消息。

### 2) Lawyer's meeting application
Lawyer Xiao submitted a meeting application on the morning of the 29th and was told that there would be a reply and arrangement within 48 hours. According to the special handling process for Xu Zhiyong's appeal case, after receiving the application, the prison will report it to the judicial department for instructions, so it is impossible to reply as soon as possible whether the meeting can be held. Lawyer Xiao is waiting for further news in the hotel.

### （三）无消息显示许志永的绝食状况，需要持续关注

目前未有家属或律师更新消息，也无法得知监狱方面是否给家属或律师施压。但可以肯定的是，根据10月23日许志永从鲁南监狱拨打的亲情电话中，不仅讲述了他绝食的起因，更加表达了自己抗争的决心。

因此，在家属和律师并未有更新消息时，我们仍然相信，许志永依旧在持续绝食。希望大家持续关注、转发、声援、行动。

### 3) No news about Xu Zhiyong's hunger strike, which needs to be continuously monitored

At present, no family members or lawyers have updated the news, and it is impossible to know whether the prison has put pressure on the family members or lawyers. But what is certain is that according to the affectionate phone call Xu Zhiyong made from Lunan Prison on October 23, he not only described the reason for his hunger strike, but also expressed his determination to fight.

Therefore, when the family and lawyers have not updated the news, we still believe that Xu Zhiyong is still on hunger strike. I hope everyone will continue to pay attention, forward, support and take action.
