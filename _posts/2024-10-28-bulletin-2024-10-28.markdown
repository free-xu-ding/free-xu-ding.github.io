**Information on Xu Zhiyong's hunger strike (2024.10.24-10.28)**

### （一）许志永绝食抗争引发外界广泛关注

23号晚上发出关于志永绝食的消息之後，外界的关注很给力。之后的几天，有一些机构和政府部门相继发出声明，或者向中国政府发去外交照会。

Xu Zhiyong's hunger strike has attracted widespread attention from the outside world
After the news about Zhiyong's hunger strike was released on the evening of the 23rd, the outside world paid great attention. In the following days, some institutions and government departments issued statements or sent diplomatic notes to the Chinese government.

### （二）鲁南监狱24日暂停狱务公开电话

10月24日，有网友试图给鲁南监狱打电话询问情况，鲁南监狱的几个对外电话同时都打不通。晚些时候有人爆出鲁南监狱狱政科科长陈磊的手机号码。试图联系陈磊的网友反映，他始终不接电话，短信也不回应。

Lunan Prison suspended the public telephone number for prison affairs on the 24th
On October 24, some netizens tried to call Lunan Prison to inquire about the situation, but several external telephones of Lunan Prison were not connected at the same time. Later, someone revealed the mobile phone number of Chen Lei, the head of the prison administration department of Lunan Prison. Netizens who tried to contact Chen Lei reported that he never answered the phone and did not respond to text messages.

### （三）鲁南监狱25日针对关注网友的询问，否认有绝食情况存在

10月25日，有网友打通了鲁南监狱狱政科的电话。接线员说话非常客气，但她否认了绝食的事情，强调监狱待许志永很好。在被问到许和李翘楚通信的问题上，她也否认了剥夺通信权的情况，并胡乱猜测说“李翘楚有病，信息肯定是她透出去的”。但众所周知，李翘楚被中断通信已近2个月，也没有会见权，同时被严格监管无法发声、甚至无法与许志永的朋友们联络，又如何能够知晓并透出消息？

Lunan Prison denied the existence of a hunger strike on the 25th in response to inquiries from concerned netizens
On October 25, some netizens called the prison administration department of Lunan Prison. The operator spoke very politely, but she denied the hunger strike and emphasized that the prison treated Xu Zhiyong very well. When asked about the communication between Xu and Li Qiaochu, she also denied the deprivation of the right to communicate, and randomly guessed that "Li Qiaochu is sick, and the information must have been leaked by her." But as we all know, Li Qiaochu has been cut off from communication for nearly 2 months and has no right to meet. At the same time, she is under strict supervision and cannot speak or even contact Xu Zhiyong's friends. How could she know and leak the news?
