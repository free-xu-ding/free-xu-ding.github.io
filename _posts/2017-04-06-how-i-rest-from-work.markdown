## 关于我们 ｜ About us

遭受不公正审判的丁家喜与许志永分别被羁押于江北监狱和日照监狱，两人在监狱中仍遭受虐待、基本人权被剥夺。与此同时，12.26大抓捕中，张忠顺已被秘密开庭尚未宣判；常玮平和李翘楚于获释后仍处于剥权期、被严密监控、释而不放的状态。我们将时刻关注他们的状况，为大、小监狱内的人发声。

Ding Jiaxi and Xu Zhiyong, who suffered unfair trials, are detained in Jiangbei Prison and Rizhao Prison respectively. They are still being abused and deprived of their basic human rights in prison. Meanwhile, during the 12.26 mass arrest, Zhang Zhongshun has been secretly tried but has not yet been sentenced; Chang Weiping and Li Qiaochu are still in the period of deprivation of rights, under strict surveillance, and released but not released after their release. We will keep an eye on their conditions and speak out for those in prisons, big and small.

**欢迎关注或者加入我们！**

我们是丁家喜和许志永的朋友或者关注者，旨在通过在海外的平台为不能说话者发声，支持为他们奔波的亲友和律师。我们也希望这是一个行动协作的平台，以具体的人和事将关注者联结起来。我们仍然需要会写作、采访、创意、美工等方面的朋友加入我们一同信息产出。悲凉意味着，我们处在最后一战，快乐意味着，我们在一起。也许彼此陌异，却通过对良知的共有，在某些时刻合而为一。那些消亡于空中的压抑的声音，时而借助编码的嘴唇唱出。在歌唱时，剧场和生活的隔离被打破了，这时没有人是我们，但人人都是。

**Welcome to follow or join us!**

We are friends or followers of Ding Jiaxi and Xu Zhiyong. We aim to speak for the speechless through overseas platforms and support their relatives, friends and lawyers who are running around for them. We also hope that this is a platform for action collaboration, connecting followers with specific people and things. We still need friends who are good at writing, interviewing, creativity, and art to join us in information output. Sadness means that we are in the last battle, and happiness means that we are together. We may be strangers to each other, but through the sharing of conscience, we become one at certain moments. Those suppressed voices that die in the air are sometimes sung with the help of coded lips. When singing, the isolation between theater and life is broken. At this time, no one is us, but everyone is.
